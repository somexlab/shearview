The numbered components are:
(1) Breadboard base (MB3030/M, Thorlabs), machined to fit a commercial microscope stage;
(2) Micrometric screws, used to align the breadboard base horizontally;
(3) Linear voice-coil actuator (Moticont LVCM-013-032-02), applying force via magnetic actuation;
(4) Linear air bearing (Physik Instrumente A-101.050), enabling frictionless translation of the moving plate;
(5) Fiber-optic displacement sensor (Philtec D100), measuring displacement via reflected infrared light;
(6) Gold-coated mirror (Thorlabs PF03-03-M01, mounted on Thorlabs MFM7/M), used as reflective target for the displacement sensor;
(7) Micrometric adjustment screws (F6MSS25 with F6MSSN1P bushings, Thorlabs) used to set the gap and fine tune the alignemnt between the two microscope slides;
(8) Locking screws, used to rigidly fix the lower structure after alignment;
(9) Upper microscope slide, mounted on the moving stage;
(10) Lower microscope slide supporting structure, fixed to the stationary base and serving as sample support.
